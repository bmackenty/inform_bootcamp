Instead of going nowhere in Open Field:
	say "Although large and beautiful, there may be other things worth seeing here."


[========== pasture ==========]
The description of Pasture is "A large pasture ringed by an old wooden fence. There is a gate to the north. There are several large oxen in the pasture, grazing, using their tails to shoo away flies, or simply laying on the ground. As you approach some of them notice you and turn their attention (and ears) in your direction.

To the west you can see an open bucolic field.".

	say "The fence blocks your path.".

An oldChurch is north of old road.


[========== old church ==========]

The printed name of oldChurch is "An small old decrepit wooden country church".

	say "There are no obvious pathways, save for the old road to the south, and the entrance to the church.".
